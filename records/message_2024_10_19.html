                <p>Key points:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>在罪上死，在基督里活。</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Words from bible:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 岂不知我们这受洗归入基督耶稣的人，是受洗归入他的死吗？ 4 所以，我们借着洗礼归入死，和他一同埋葬，原是叫我们一举一动有新生的样式，像基督借着父的荣耀从死里复活一样。 5 我们若在他死的形状上与他联合，也要在他复活的形状上与他联合。 6 因为知道，我们的旧人和他同钉十字架，使罪身灭绝，叫我们不再做罪的奴仆， 7 因为已死的人是脱离了罪。 8 我们若是与基督同死，就信必与他同活。 9 因为知道，基督既从死里复活，就不再死，死也不再做他的主了。 10 他死是向罪死了，只有一次；他活是向神活着。 11 这样，你们向罪也当看自己是死的；向神，在基督耶稣里，却当看自己是活的。【罗6:3-11】<br>Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.
                      5For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. 6For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin— 7because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.
                      8Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. 9For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. 10The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.
                      11In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. (Romans 6:3-11)</li>
